index is an effort to create a collective of resources and free information that anyone can use or contribute to, without any cost. 
we believe information should be free for everyone and not locked behind a paywall.

this website works without javascript and contains no trackers or analytics. it is hosted on vercel[0] and is 100% open-source
each page is a markdown file that is parsed into a html readable file, made possible by astro[1]

use this website and the information it provides however you'd like. the mission here is to make the information known and accessable to anyone
hope you appreciate this project as much as i do.
